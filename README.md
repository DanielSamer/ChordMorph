# 🎵 Chord Scale Converter

## 🚀 Elevate Your Musical Creativity
The **Chord Scale Converter** is a powerful Java-based tool designed for musicians, songwriters, and producers who need to seamlessly transpose chord progressions across different musical scales. Whether you're composing, arranging, or experimenting with harmonies, this tool simplifies the process and ensures accuracy.

## ✨ Features That Impress
- 🎼 **Instant Chord Transposition** – Convert chords between Major and Minor scales effortlessly.
- ✅ **Error-Free Input Handling** – Prevents invalid chord and scale entries.
- 🔄 **Accurate Shift Calculation** – Uses music theory-based transposition logic.
- 🎹 **Sharp (`#`) and Minor (`m`) Notation Support** – Ensures smooth conversions for all common chords.
- ⏱️ **Quick & Efficient** – Works in real time for rapid music experimentation.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?
- **Musicians & Songwriters** – Quickly test how chord progressions sound in different keys.
- **Music Producers** – Adapt compositions without manual transposition.
- **Guitarists & Pianists** – Practice and play along with songs in various keys.

## 🔥 How It Works
1. 🎵 Enter your chord progression (e.g., `C G Am F`).
2. 🎼 Select a **source scale** (e.g., `C Major`).
3. 🎯 Choose a **target scale** (e.g., `D Major`).
4. 🚀 Get your transposed chord progression instantly!

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
### 📌 Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- A terminal or command prompt.

### ▶️ Running the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanielSamer/ChordScaleConverter.git
   cd ChordScaleConverter
   ```
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```sh
   javac ChordScaleConverter.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   java ChordScaleConverter
   ```

## 🏆 Example Usage
```
Enter the chords (separated by spaces, e.g., C G Am F): C G Am F
Enter the source scale (e.g., C Major): C Major
Enter the target scale (e.g., D Major): D Major
Converted chords: D A Bm G
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
🔹 Support for **7th, diminished, and augmented chords**.
🔹 Develop a **GUI-based version** for a seamless experience.
🔹 Expand scale support (e.g., **modes, blues scale**).

## Software Engineering 
This project demonstrates **algorithmic problem-solving**, **data structures (HashMaps & Arrays)**, and **real-world application of music theory in programming**. It highlights strong Java skills, clean code practices, and a clear understanding of user needs.
